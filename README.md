# SVM / SVC from scratch
<p>building the support vector machine (svm) model from scratch using brute force technique<p/>

## Overview / Note:
this project implements a brute-force linear SVM classifier from scratch (without scikit-learn) and applies it to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. it covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and basic evaluation. **this SVM implementation is for educational purposes and is not optimized for large or high-dimensional datasets**.

## Dataset Used:
**Breast Cancer Wisconsin** <br>
